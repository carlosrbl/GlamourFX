Name of the Proyect: GlamourFX

Idea of the Proyect: Appointment management of a hairdresser's salon

Description of the Proyect: 
- We want to realize a project that implements an appointment management simulation of a hairdressing salon. Our main idea is to use JavaFX to create a very realistic graphical interface.

¿How did we use github?


We have been using Github as a way to store our project as a repository. Every time we start working, the first thing we do is do a pull so that we can receive the changes that our colleague has made. We also try to avoid working on our colleagues' classes as much as possible,because sometimes when we try to upload the changes it can give errors due to the merge. After all this projects I think that GitHub well be an important tool for all of us in our daily live of work.
